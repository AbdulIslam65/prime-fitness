<h2>Cycling and fitness: </h2>
 5 min read
<p>A while back it seemed that cyclists were allergic to gyms and only used them during the pre-season to
lift some weights and do strength training. Then, they would forget about the gym for the rest of the 
year, not using it even for spinning, a fitness activity so similar to cycling</p>.

<p>Luckily, this has changed and several studies have shown that going to the gym regularly to do strength
training or other activities such as Yoga, Pilates or Body Pump, is good for our overall fitness, helps
avoid injuries, corrects muscle imbalances, breaks the routine and improves our social life.
So what can a cyclist do at the gym? The answer is: everything. From lifting weights to Zumba, HIIT
workout, functional training such as CrossFit, etc. Pretty much every activity at the gym can help you  
in one way or another to improve your cycling performance. Let‚Äôs take a look at the benefits of some of
Spinning</p>

 <p>Spinning or indoor cycling classes are available at almost all gyms in the world and are one of
 the most popular activities. These group classes are accompanied by motivating music and usually last
 about 45 minutes. It‚Äôs a high-intensity exercise with frequent changes of pace, making it a great
  interval  workout for cyclists.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôve never tried a spinning class don‚Äôt wait any longer. They are fun, the group atmosphere is 
great and the instructor gives you that extra motivation to push yourself and to let out every last
drop of sweat. You should hydrate well, bring a towel, your bib shorts and a comfortable fitness
T-shirt that is highly breathable and wicks away the sweat.Body Pump</p>
